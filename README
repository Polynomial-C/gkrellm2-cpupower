============================

Description:
------------
gkrellm2-cpupower is a plugin for gkrellm 2.0 (http://www.gkrellm.net) called
cpupower.so displaying the current CPU frequency numerically and by
the position of a slider, optionally the current cpufreq governor
and the CPU temperature from /proc/acpi

The plugin reads the CPU frequency and the cpufreq governor using cpupower
and displays it.

Clicking on the governor name will toggle the governor.
Moving the slider will reset the CPU frequency if the userspace
governor is active.

The slider position also represents the current frequency, on the left
for 0, on the right for the maximal frequency, which is determined as
the maximum found
- in the configuration file
- using cpupower
- in current operation
Note: The maximal frequency found is NOT saved in the configuration
file unless the configuration page is viewed by pressing the right
mouse button on the plugin.

Options:
--------
Right-click on the plugin to set the options:
- The display of the governor name may be switched off
- The display of the slider may be switched off
- The plugin can set the userspace governor when moving the slider
- The control for multiple processors can be coupled
