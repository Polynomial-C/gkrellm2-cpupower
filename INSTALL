Installation of gkrellm2-cpupower
=================================
Christoph Winkelmann <chw@tks6.net>

Requirements
------------
* gkrellm 2.0.0 or higher
* linux kernel >= 2.6.0 including the respective cpufreq-driver for your CPU
* cpupower
  (included in the Linux kernel source under tools/power/cpupower)

If you want to change the CPU frequency and/or cpufreq governor using
the plugin, you need moreover:

* sudo (http://www.sudo.ws/sudo/) 

Installation
------------
1) To compile the plugin, type 'make'
2) To install the plugin to foo/usr/lib/gkrellm2/plugins/ and
   the bash script cpufreqnextgovernor to foo/usr/sbin/, type
     'make DESTDIR=foo install'
   Alternatively, you may install the plugin manually to
   ~/.gkrellm2/plugins/ (if you don't have root permissions)

Post-Install
------------
1) To allow the plugin to set frequencies and governors, add the following lines
   to your /etc/sudoers file, using visudo (as root, replacing /usr/bin with
   the path to cpupower on your system):
   <user> <hostname> = (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/cpupower -c [0-9]* frequency-set -g userspace
   <user> <hostname> = (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/cpupower -c [0-9]* frequency-set -f [0-9]*
   <user> <hostname> = (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/cpufreqnextgovernor [0-9]*
   where <user> is the user that runs gkrellm
   and <hostname> is the name of the host to set the CPU frequency/governor.
   Alternatively you may type 'make install-sudo', which tries to do this
   automatically. This does not involve the syntax checking of visudo.
   Use 'make install-sudo' at your own risk!
2) To allow the bash script (or any userspace program) to change the
   CPU frequency, the userspace governor must be available.
